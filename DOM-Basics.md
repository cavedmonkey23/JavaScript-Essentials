# DOM Basics

This is a demonstration of basics interaction with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.

## Description

## Features

- Selecting elements by ID, class, or tag name.
- Modifying element content and attributes.
- Creating new elements dynamically.
- Event handling and DOM event listeners.

## Selecting Elements

To select elements in the DOM, you can use various methods such as:

- `getElementById` : Selects an element by its unique ID attribute.
- `getElementByClassName` : Selects elements by their class name.
- `getElementByTagName` : Selects elements by their tag name.
- `querySelector` : Selects the first element that matches aCSS selector.
- `querySelectorAll` : Selects all elements that match a CSS selector.


## Modifying Elements

Once you've selected an element, you can modify it's content, attributes, or style. Some common operations include:

- `innerHTML` : Gets or sets the HTML content inside an element.
- `textContent` : Gets or sets the text content inside an element.
- `setAttribute` : Sets the value of an attribute of an element.
- `getAttribute` : Gets the vaue of an attribute from an element.
- `classList` : Provides methods to add, remove, toggle CSS classes on an element.
- `style` : Allows you to modify the inline CSS style of an element.


## Creating and Manipulating Elements

You can create new elements and insert them into the DOM using the following methods:

- `createElement` : Creates a new HTML element.
- `appendChild` : Adds a new child element to an existing element.
- `removeChild` : Removes a child element from its parent.
- `cloneNode` : Creates a copy of an element.
- `parentNode` : Accesses the parent node of an element.


## Event Handling

DOM events allow you to respond to user interactions or other actions that occur in the browser . Here's how to handle events :

- `addEventListener` : Attaches an event listener to an element.
- `removeEventListener` : Removes an event listener from an element.
- `event.target` : Accesses the element that triggered the event.
- `event.preventDefault` : Prevents the default behavior of an event.
